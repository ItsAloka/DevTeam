// Roles used to be a fixed list of software job titles, and the checklist attached to each was
// written for web software — a research, legal, analysis or writing task got asked about session
// fixation and httponly cookies. A project now declares its own roles in `.devteam/roles.json`.
//
// The important separation, and the reason this file exists rather than a bigger enum somewhere:
//
//   * A role NAME is domain vocabulary. `fact-checker`, `domain-expert`, `copy-editor`,
//     `structural-engineer` — DevTeam has no opinion about these and never should.
//   * A role BEHAVIOUR is scheduling semantics. There are exactly two, they are the only things the
//     scheduler understands, and adding a third is a real design decision rather than a config edit:
//       - `verifies`: this role reads the work rather than changing it, so it waits for pending
//         writers, its completion is what earns the right to approve or to request changes, and its
//         presence alone means the task is in review.
//       - `plans`: this role decides what the team does next, so an open one means the task is still
//         being planned, and it is what DevTeam seeds a new or resumed task with.
//
// A project maps its own vocabulary onto those two. `fact-checker` sets `verifies: true` and the
// review gate treats it exactly as `reviewer`, with no scheduler change and no new role name baked
// into any SQL.
//
// JSON rather than YAML deliberately: DevTeam has three runtime dependencies and a YAML parser would
// be a fourth, bought for one config file that is read once per project.

export const ROLES_CONFIG_PATH = path.join(".devteam", "roles.json");

// The software defaults, unchanged from when they were hardcoded, so an existing project that never
// writes a config file behaves exactly as it did before. These are also what `devteam roles --init`
// writes out, as a starting point to edit rather than a set of names to keep.
