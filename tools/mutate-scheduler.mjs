// Mutation testing for the scheduling core. Breaks one scheduler rule at a time and confirms the
// property suite catches it. A mutant that survives means the corresponding invariant is decorative
// rather than load-bearing.
//
// Run from the repo root:  node tools/mutate-scheduler.mjs
//
// It edits src/devteam/store.mjs in place and restores it afterwards, printing whether the restore
// was byte-identical. Do not run it with uncommitted changes to store.mjs you care about.
//
// Expected today: 12 caught, 1 equivalent (M9 - pending_write.id != a.id is implied by the
// creation-order rule, so removing it changes no behavior).
//
// Exit code: 0 when every behavioural mutant was caught. A surviving mutant, or an anchor that no
// longer matches the code it was written against, exits 1 — both mean this tool is no longer
// testing what it claims to. Mutants marked `equivalent` are exempt, and only those.
